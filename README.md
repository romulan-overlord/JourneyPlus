## About The Project

Undergrad final year project.
This is an expansive journalling web application with networking possible, allowing users to publish beautifully crafted entries as blogs easily accessible to their network.

What expansive journalling entails:
* The traditional feeling of journalling is retained with the text component.
* Add snippets of your memories not describable by words in the form of pictures, videos and audios.
* Turn your journal entry into an experience in itself with customisable background images and background audio.
* Collaborate with your friends to create journal entries together in real time.
